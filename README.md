# SE202 Rust - Virtual Machine
The purpose of this repository is to show a little of the Rust course I followed in my master's 1 programme, as part of the Embedded Systems study track I chose. Here it's possible to find a virtual machine programmed in Rust. 

## Meta
 * **Master in Electrical Engineering - Institut Polytechnique de Paris**
 * **Course:** SE202 Rust
 * **Author:** Alaf DO NASCIMENTO SANTOS
 * **License**: [MIT](LICENSE)
 * **Year:** 2023

## Installing Rust
If you are using a Linux machine, the following command would be enough: ***curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh***
For more information, please take a look at the Rust official website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

## How to compile and execute the project?
After installing cargo, you can use the command ***cargo build***, which compiles the project.

For running a Rust programme, you can use the command line ***cargo run examples/name.bin***, replacing "name.bin" by the binary file you want to virtualise.

## How to Contribute to the Project
- Any implementation that could lead to a more optimised code for the different methods already designed would be a nice improvement for this project. 

So feel free to fork, change, and pull request ðŸ˜Š
